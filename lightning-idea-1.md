# Small 1600s village

## What is Bitcoin
If I could illustrate what Bitcoin is in a **poorly** manner, I would summarize it like this:  
A king exists, the king has a big bank in his kingdown that keeps track of all transactions. There are many small villages situated within the country,
the citizens can call the king's carriage to see all the transactions ever made for free and they can also ask the carriage to take their transaction so it stays 
in the king's bank, however, to do that they need to pay a small fee.

## The problem
The problem with is that if a citizen likes to buy a lot of things, he would have to pay a fee for each time he buys something, 
even if it's a cheap thing like a coffee. Also, it takes a while for the carriage to get to the king's bank, so if the citizen 
wants his transaction to be recorded fast enough he would need to pay a big fee.
